# Create sub-directory under grading for each student and name it
# by the student's user name (that can be extracted from the added prefix
# of a filename)
# 
# Remove the added prefix from each filename in the data directory
# and place them into each student's subdirectory respectively
# ex sub-directory edwardsj would have four files: cipher.c, LetFreq.txt,
# makefile, and memo.txt. (note that the name of the file created by BlackBoard
# is renamed as memo.txt!!!!)
