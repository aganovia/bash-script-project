# bash-script-project
Project 3 for CIS241, Fall 2019.

Part 1 (DONE; needs more testing):
Write a Bash script called newname that renames a file.
- takes two command line arguments ($newname a.txt b.txt)
- if new file name already exists, loop through new file names by sequence number (b.txt.1, b.txt.2, etc) until file name is valid 

Part 2 (STARTED):
Write a script that unzips downloaded files, renames files, and reorganizes files for each student in a course.
- prompt the user for the name of the zip file and unzip it into a data directory under the project1 directory (should work for any zip file with files from any number of students)
- create a directory under project1 called grading, and create sub-directories under it for each student by the student's username
- idk the rest is in the description why am i typing this out
