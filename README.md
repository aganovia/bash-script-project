# bash-script-project
Project 3 for CIS241, Fall 2019.

Part 1:
A Bash script called newname that renames a file. Takes two command line arguments (e.g. $newname a.txt b.txt). If the new file name already exists, loops through new file names by sequence number (e.g. b.txt.1, b.txt.2, etc.) until valid file name is generated.

Part 2:
A Bash script that unzips downloaded files, renames the files, and organizes them by students in a course (represented by directories).
